            <p>The 2/1 Buy Down Mortgage allows the borrower to qualify at below market rates so they can borrow more.
                The initial starting interest rate increases by 1% at the end of the first year and adjusts again by
                another 1% at the end of the second year. It then remains at a fixed interest rate for the remainder of
                the loan term. Borrowers often refinance at the end of the second year to obtain a better long term
                rate; however, even keeping the loan in place for three full years or more will keep their average
                interest rate in line with the original market conditions.</p></div>

                amortization can occur when an ARM has a payment cap that results in monthly payments not high enough to
